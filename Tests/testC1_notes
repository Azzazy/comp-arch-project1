This is a minimal test is meant to test the Extender.v module by issuing
some compressed instructions.
The program starts by initialising some registers using the c.li
instruction.
The following arithmetic instructions are produce values such that
the following branch is not taken. A variation of this test was to
replace the c.beqz with c.bnez to check that if the branching is 
done correctly.
Next, the swsp and lwsp are checked by loading and storing the same
value, and xoring both registers, the output is Zero and the branch 
(c.bnez) is not taken which shows that the load and store where done
correctly.
