The li instructions initialise the registers
The testing for auipc, lui and R-format instructions consists of subtracting
the output of lui from that of auipc, the result should equal the pc of the 
previous instruction (the AUIPC instruction pcout=24).
The AND instruction should ouput an 8; the BEQ should take the branch.
the output of the slli (32) is greater than the output of the or (24), 
1 should be written to x10.
The lui instruction will fill the upper 20 bits of x11 while the ori will fill
all 32 bits of x13; a comparison by bgeu should take the branch. The branch
will fall at another comparison to test bge (should not be taken).
Right afterwards, there is a jal instruction that will take execution to
a location in memory with the different store instructions followed by a 
load instruction which is immediately followed by a jalr instruction to
test for the load-use hazard (valid only in case of a jump instruction since
branching is executed in the ID stage). Note that the value loaded in rs1 used by jalr
is the same as that saved in rd of the jal preceding it in execution.
