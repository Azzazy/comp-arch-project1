Test1
To test blt, addi and jalr, a closed loop is added to the program used
in the lab experiment.
To test lui, the output of the alu is monitored on the fpga.

Test2
To test bltu instruction, test 1 has been modified by replacing blt by bltu.
The instruction bltu x12,x13,loop compares  x12 and x13 with x13 holding a
negative number (-100), yet the branch is taken since -100 is decoded as
an unsigned number. Other branching instructions were tested using similar
strategy.

Test3
test 3 only consists of checking the auipc instruction
