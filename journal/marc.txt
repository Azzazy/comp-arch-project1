25/3:	Started working on the single cycle datapath.
	Enumerated some of the needed tasks (shifter, new control unit...)
	Rewired the Lab's pipelined version as a single cycle.
	Created some dummy verilog modules to synthesize the wiring.
30/3:	Received an updated version, reviewing.
	No difference between bge/blt and bgeu/bltu.			FIXED
	Missing connections in top module.
	Data memory implemented as big endian.				FIXED
	Zeroed control flags for system and fence isntructions.	
	Relocated mux zeroing first alu input for LUI instruction
	before the register file, using reg x0.
	Found incorrect control signals (control unit).			FIXED
	Found error in the mapping between the ALU control
	unit and the ALU						FIXED
31/3	Fixed error in branching (removed the shifter)					FIXED
	Due to the writing in the reg file on the negative
	clk edge, the first load instruction was not executed
	correctly, added a nop as first instruction.
	Successfully tested the instructions from the lab exp.
02/4	Testing the full datapath.
	Report/Documentation.
